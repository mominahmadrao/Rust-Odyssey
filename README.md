# ðŸ¦€ Rust Odyssey

Welcome to **Rust Odyssey** â€” my personal voyage into the world of Rust.  
Iâ€™m doing this purely as a **hobby project** to learn a low-level language, strengthen my programming logic, and explore systems programming concepts.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
- Learn Rust from scratch as a fun side project.
- Explore low-level concepts like memory management, lifetimes, and concurrency.
- Build small projects and share progress publicly.
